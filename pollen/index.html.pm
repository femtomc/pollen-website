        I'm currently a first year PhD student at ◊link["http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/"]{MIT ProbComp}. 

        Previously, I worked as a research scientist at ◊link["https://beacon.bio/"]{Beacon Biosignals} and as a machine learning scientist at ◊link["https://cra.com/"]{Charles River Analytics}.

            (◊link["https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8kaWc0EAAAAJ&hl=en"]{Google Scholar}) My research has typically followed a core set of themes:

                ◊ol{
                    ◊li{◊helio{Domain-specific language design}}
                    ◊li{◊helio{Program analysis, especially abstract interpretation}}
                    ◊li{◊helio{Compiler infrastructure development}}
                }

            I’ve mostly been interested in applying these themes to problems in artificial intelligence. My main focus has been probabilistic programming, but recently I’ve also begun to explore these themes in the context of automatic differentiation and programming paradigms with other unique domain semantics (like quantum computing).
